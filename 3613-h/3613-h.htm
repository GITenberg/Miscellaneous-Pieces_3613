245</span><span class="GutSmall">OF THE</span><br />
TRINITY AND A CHRISTIAN.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center" class="gutsumm"><i>How a young or
shaken Christian should demean himself under the weighty thoughts
of the Doctrine of the Trinity or Plurality of Persons in the
eternal Godhead</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> reason why I say a <i>young</i>
or <i>shaken</i> Christian, is, because some that are not young,
but of an ancient standing, may not only be assaulted with
violent temptations concerning gospel-principles, but a second
time may become a child, a babe, a shallow man, in the things of
God: especially, either when by backsliding he hath provoked God
to leave him, or when some new, unexpected, and (as to present
strength) over weighty objection doth fall upon the spirit, by
means of which great shakings of mind do commonly attend such a
soul in the most weighty matters of the concerns of faith, of
which this is one that I have supposed in the above-mentioned
question: Wherefore passing other things, I will come directly to
that, and briefly propose some helps to a soul in such a
case.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; The first preparative.</p>
<p><i>First</i>, Then, be sure thou keep close to the Word of God
for that is the revelation of the mind and will of God, both as
to the truth of what is either in himself or ways, and also as to
what he requireth and expecteth of thee, either concerning faith
in, or obedience to, what he hath so revealed.&nbsp; Now for thy
better performing of this, I shall give thee in brief these
following directions.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Suffer thyself, by the authority of the Word, to be
persuaded that the Scripture indeed is the Word of God the
Scriptures of truth, the words of the Holy One; and that they
therefore must be every one true, pure, and for ever settled in
heaven.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Conclude therefore from the former doctrine, that
that God whose words they are, is able to make a reconciliation
and most sweet and harmonious agreement with all the sayings
therein, how obscure, cross, dark, and contradictory soever they
seem to thee.&nbsp; To understand all mysteries, to have all
knowledge, to be able to comprehend with all saints, is a great
work; enough to crush the spirit, and to stretch the strings of
the most capacious, widened soul that breatheth on this side
glory, be they notwithstanding exceedingly enlarged by
revelation.&nbsp; Paul, when he was caught up to heaven, saw that
which was unlawful, because impossible, for man to utter.&nbsp;
And saith Christ to the reasoning Pharisee, &ldquo;If I have told
you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall you believe if
I tell you of heavenly things?&rdquo;&nbsp; It is great lewdness,
and also insufferable arrogancy, to come to the Word of God, as
conceiting already that whatever thou readest must either by thee
be understood, or of itself fall to the ground as a senseless
error.&nbsp; But God is wiser than man, wherefore fear thou him,
and tremble at his word, saying still, with godly suspicion of
thine own infirmity, What I see not, teach thou me; and, Thou art
God only wise; but as for me, I am as a beast before thee.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Take heed of taking a part of the Word only, lest
thou thereby go away with the truth as mangled in pieces.&nbsp;
For instance, where thou readest, &ldquo;The Lord our God is one
Lord,&rdquo; there take heed that thou dost not thence conclude,
then there are not three persons in the Godhead: when thou
readest of &ldquo;the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Spirit,&rdquo; then take heed of concluding there must therefore
either be three Gods, or else that Jesus Christ and the Holy
Ghost are not true God, but the Father only.&nbsp; Wherefore to
help thee here, observe,</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; The second preparative.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; That the Christian religion requireth credit
concerning every doctrine contained in the Word; credit, I say,
according to the true relation of every sentence that the Holy
Ghost hath revealed for the asserting, maintaining, or
vindicating that same truth.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; And therefore, hence it is that a Christian is not
called a doer, a reasoner, an objector, and perverse disputer,
but a believer.&nbsp; Be thou an example to &ldquo;the
believers;&rdquo; and, &ldquo;believers&rdquo; were &ldquo;added
to the church,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Therefore, know again, that the Word, if it saith and
expresseth that this or that is so and so, as to the matter in
hand, thou art bound and obliged, both by the name, profession,
and the truth, unto which thou hast joined thyself, to assent to,
confess, and acknowledge the same, even then when thy carnal
reason will not stoop thereto.&nbsp; &ldquo;Righteous art thou, O
God,&rdquo; saith Jeremiah, &ldquo;yet let me plead with thee;
Wherefore do the wicked live?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mark, first he
acknowledgeth that God&rsquo;s way with the wicked is just and
right, even then when yet he could not see the reason of his
actions and dispensations towards them.&nbsp; The same reason is
good as to our present case: and hence it is that the apostle
saith, the spiritual armour of Christians should be much
exercised against those high towering and self-exalting
imaginations, that within our own bosoms do exalt themselves
against the knowledge of God; that every thought or carnal
reasoning may be not only taken, but brought a captive into
obedience to Christ; that is, be made to stoop to the Word of
God, and to give way and place to the doctrine therein contained,
how cross soever our thoughts and the Word lie to each
other.&nbsp; And it is observable that he here saith, &ldquo;they
exalt themselves against the knowledge of God;&rdquo; which
cannot be understood, that our carnal, natural reason doth exalt
itself against an eternal deity, simply considered; for that
nature itself doth gather from the very things that are made,
even his eternal power and Godhead: it must be then that they
exalt themselves against that God as thus and thus revealed in
the Word, to wit, against the knowledge of one God, consisting of
three persons, Father, Son, and Spirit; for this is the doctrine
of the Scriptures of truth: and therefore it is observable these
thoughts must be brought captive, and be made subject in
particular to the Lord Jesus Christ, as to the second person in
the Godhead: for the Father is ever acknowledged by all that
profess the least of religion; but the Son is that
stumbling-stone and rock of offence, against which thousands dash
themselves in pieces; though in him are hid all the treasures of
wisdom and knowledge, and in him dwells the fulness of the
Godhead bodily.</p>
<h2><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span><span class="GutSmall">OF THE</span><br />
LAW AND A CHRISTIAN.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> law was given twice upon Mount
Sinai, but the appearance of the Lord, when he gave it the second
time, was wonderfully different from that of his, when at the
first he delivered it to Israel.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; When he gave it the first time, he caused his terror
and severity to appear before Moses, to the shaking of his soul
and the dismaying of Israel; but when he gave it the second time,
he caused all his goodness to pass before Moses, to the comfort
of his conscience and the bowing of his heart.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; When he gave it the first time, it was with
thunderings and lightnings, with blackness and darkness, with
flame and smoke, and a tearing sound of the trumpet; but when he
gave it the second time, it was with a proclamation of his name
to be merciful, gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in
goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving
iniquity, transgressions, and sins.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; When he gave it the first time, Moses was called to
go up to receive it through the fire, which made him exceedingly
fear and quake: but when he went to receive it the second time,
he was laid in a clift of the rock.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; From all which I gather, that, though as to the
matter of the law, both as to its being given the first time and
the second, it binds the unbeliever under the pains of eternal
damnation (if he close not with Christ by faith); yet as to the
manner of its giving at these two times, I think the first doth
more principally intend its force as a covenant of works, not at
all respecting the Lord Jesus; but this second time not (at least
in the manner of its being given) respecting such a covenant, but
rather as a rule or directory to those who already are found in
the clift of the rock Christ; for the saint himself, though he be
without law to God, as it is considered the first or old
covenant, yet even he is not without law to him as considered
under grace; not without law to God, but under the law to
Christ.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Though, therefore, it be sad with the unbeliever,
because he only and wholly standeth under the law as it is given
in fire, in smoke, in blackness, and darkness, and thunder; all
which threaten him with eternal ruin if he fulfil not the utmost
tittle thereof; yet the believer stands to the law under no such
consideration, neither is he so at all to hear or regard it, for
he is now removed from thence to the blessed mountain of
Zion&mdash;to grace and forgiveness of sins; he is now, I say, by
faith in the Lord Jesus, shrouded under so perfect and blessed a
righteousness, that this thundering law of Mount Sinai cannot
find the least fault or diminution therein, but rather approveth
and alloweth thereof, either when or wherever it find it.&nbsp;
This is called the righteousness of God without the law, and also
said to be witnessed by both the law and the prophets; even the
righteousness of God, which is by faith in Jesus Christ unto all
and upon all them that believe; for there is no difference.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Wherefore, whenever thou who believest in Jesus, dost
hear the law in its thundering and lightning fits, as if it would
burn up heaven and earth, then say thou, I am freed from this
law, these thunderings have nothing to do with my soul; nay, even
this law, while it thus thunders and roars, it doth both allow
and approve of my righteousness.&nbsp; I know that Hagar would
sometimes be domineering and high, even in Sarah&rsquo;s house,
and against her; but this she is not to be suffered to do, nay,
though Sarah herself be barren; wherefore, serve it also as Sarah
served her, and expel her out from thy house.&nbsp; My meaning
is, when this law with its thundering threatenings doth attempt
to lay hold on thy conscience, shut it out with a promise of
grace; cry, The inn is taken up already; the Lord Jesus is here
entertained, and here is no room for the law.&nbsp; Indeed, if it
will be content with being my informer, and so lovingly leave off
to judge me, I will be content, it shall be in my sight, I will
also delight therein; but otherwise, I being now made upright
without it, and that too with that righteousness which this law
speaks well of and approveth, I may not, will not, cannot dare
not make it my Saviour and judge, nor suffer it to set up its
government in my conscience; for by so doing, I fall from grace,
and Christ Jesus doth profit me nothing.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Thus, therefore, the soul that is married to him that
is raised up from the dead, both may and ought to deal with this
law of God; yea, it doth greatly dishonour its Lord and refuse
its gospel privileges, if it at any time otherwise doth, whatever
it seeth or feels.&nbsp; &ldquo;The law hath power over the wife
so long as her husband liveth, but if her husband be dead she is
freed from that law; so that she is no adulteress though she be
married to another man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed, so long as thou art
alive to sin, and to thy righteousness which is of the law, so
long thou hast them for thy husband, and they must reign over
thee; but when once they are become dead unto thee&mdash;as they
then most certainly will when thou closest with the Lord Jesus
Christ&mdash;then, I say, thy former husbands have no more to
meddle with thee; thou art freed from their law.&nbsp; Set the
case: A woman be cast into prison for a debt of hundreds of
pounds; if after this she marry, yea, though while she is in the
jailor&rsquo;s hand, in the same day that she is joined to her
husband, her debt is all become his; yea, and the law also that
arrested and imprisoned this woman, as freely tells her, go: she
is freed, saith Paul, from that; and so saith the law of this
land.</p>
<p>The sum, then, of what hath been said is this&mdash;The
Christian hath now nothing to do with the law, as it thundereth
and burneth on Sinai, or as it bindeth the conscience to wrath
and the displeasure of God for sin; for from its thus appearing,
it is freed by faith in Christ.&nbsp; Yet it is to have regard
thereto, and is to count it holy, just, and good; which, that it
may do, it is always, whenever it seeth or regards it, to
remember that he who giveth it to us &ldquo;is merciful,
gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and
truth,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>

257</span>BUNYAN&rsquo;S LAST SERMON:<br />
<span class="GutSmall">PREACHED JULY 1688.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<i>Which were
born</i>, <i>not of blood</i>, <i>nor of the will of the
flesh</i>, <i>nor of the will of man</i>, <i>but of
God</i>;&rdquo; John i. 13.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> words have a dependence on what
goes before, and therefore I must direct you to them for the
right understanding of it.&nbsp; You have it
thus,&mdash;&ldquo;He came to his own, but his own received him
not; but as many as received him, to them gave he power to become
the sons of God, even to them which believe on his name; which
were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, but of
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the words before, you have two
things&mdash;</p>
<p><i>First</i>, Some of his own rejecting him when he offered
himself to them.</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, Others of his own receiving him, and making
him welcome.&nbsp; Those that reject him he also passes by; but
those that receive him, he gives them power to become the sons of
God.&nbsp; Now, lest any one should look upon it as good luck or
fortune, says he, &ldquo;They were born, not of blood, nor of the
will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; They that did not receive him, they were only
born of flesh and blood; but those that receive him, they have
God to their father, they receive the doctrine of Christ with a
vehement desire.</p>
<p><i>First</i>, I will shew you what he means by
&ldquo;blood.&rdquo;&nbsp; They that believe are born to it, as
an heir is to an inheritance; they are born of God; not of flesh,
nor of the will of man, but of God; not of blood&mdash;that is,
not by generation; not born to the kingdom of heaven by the
flesh; not because I am the son of a godly man or woman.&nbsp;
That is meant by blood, Acts xvii. 26, &ldquo;He has made of one
blood all nations.&rdquo;&nbsp; But when he says here, &ldquo;not
of blood,&rdquo; he rejects all carnal privileges they did boast
of.&nbsp; They boasted they were Abraham&rsquo;s seed.&nbsp; No,
no, says he, it is not of blood; think not to say you have
Abraham to your father, you must be born of God if you go to the
kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, &ldquo;Nor of the will of the
flesh.&rdquo;&nbsp; What must we understand by that?</p>
<p>It is taken for those vehement inclinations that are in man to
all manner of looseness, fulfilling the desires of the
flesh.&nbsp; That must not be understood here; men are made the
children of God by fulfilling their lustful desires; it must be
understood here in the best sense.&nbsp; There is not only in
carnal men a will to be vile, but there is in them a will to be
saved also&mdash;a will to go to heaven also.&nbsp; But this it
will not do, it will not privilege a man in the things of the
kingdom of God.&nbsp; Natural desires after the things of another
world, they are not an argument to prove a man shall go to heaven
whenever he dies.&nbsp; I am not a free willer, I do abhor it;
yet there is not the wickedest man but he desires some time or
other to be saved.&nbsp; He will read some time or other, or, it
may be, pray; but this will not do&mdash;&ldquo;It is not in him
that wills, nor in him that runs, but in God that shews
mercy;&rdquo; there is willing and running, and yet to no
purpose; Rom. ix. 16, &ldquo;Israel, which followed after the law
of righteousness, have not obtained it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here I do
not understand as if the apostle had denied a virtuous course of
life to be the way to heaven, but that a man without grace,
though he have natural gifts, yet he shall not obtain privilege
to go to heaven, and be the son of God.&nbsp; Though a man
without grace may have a will to be saved, yet he cannot have
that will God&rsquo;s way.&nbsp; Nature, it cannot know anything
but the things of nature; the things of God knows no man but by
the Spirit of God; unless the Spirit of God be in you, it will
leave you on this side the gates of heaven&mdash;&ldquo;Not of
blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but
of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may be some may have a will, a desire
that Ishmael may be saved; know this, it will not save thy
child.&nbsp; If it were our will, I would have you all go to
heaven.&nbsp; How many are there in the world that pray for their
children, and cry for them, and ready to die; and this will not
do?&nbsp; God&rsquo;s will is the rule of all; it is only through
Jesus Christ, &ldquo;which were born, not of flesh, nor of the
will of man, but of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now I come to the
doctrine.</p>
<p>Men that believe in Jesus Christ to the effectual receiving of
Jesus Christ, they are born to it.&nbsp; He does not say they
<i>shall</i> be born to it, but they <i>are</i> born to it; born
of God, unto God, and the things of God, before they receive God
to eternal salvation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Except a man be born again, he
cannot see the kingdom of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now unless he be born
of God, he cannot see it.&nbsp; Suppose the kingdom of God be
what it will, he cannot see it before he be begotten of God;
suppose it be the Gospel, he cannot see it before he be brought
into a state of regeneration; believing is the consequence of the
new birth, &ldquo;not of blood, nor of the will of man, but of
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>First</i>, I will give you a clear description of it under
one similitude or two.&nbsp; A child, before it be born into the
world, is in the dark dungeon of its mother&rsquo;s womb; so a
child of God, before he be born again, is in the dark dungeon of
sin, sees nothing of the kingdom of God, therefore it is called a
new birth; the same soul has love one way in its carnal
condition, another way when it is born again.</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, As it is compared to a birth, resembling a
child in his mother&rsquo;s womb, so it is compared to a man
being raised out of the grave; and to be born again is to be
raised out of the grave of sin&mdash;&ldquo;Awake, thou that
sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; To be raised from the grave of sin is to be
begotten and born; Rev. i. 5.&nbsp; There is a famous instance of
Christ&mdash;&ldquo;He is the first-begotten from the dead, he is
the first-born from the dead;&rdquo; unto which our regeneration
alludeth,&mdash;that is, if you be born again by seeking those
things that are above, then there is a similitude betwixt
Christ&rsquo;s resurrection and the new birth; which were born,
which were restored out of this dark world, and translated out of
the kingdom of this dark world into the kingdom of his dear Son,
and made us live a new life; this is to be born again; and he
that is delivered from the mother&rsquo;s womb, it is the help of
the mother; so he that is born of God, it is by the Spirit of
God.&nbsp; I must give you a few consequences of new birth.</p>
<p>First of all, a child, you know, is incident to cry as soon as
it comes into the world; for if there be no noise, they say it is
dead.&nbsp; You that are born of God, and Christians, if you be
not criers, there is no spiritual life in you; if you be born of
God, you are crying ones; as soon as he has raised you out of the
dark dungeon of sin, you cannot but cry to God, What must I do to
be saved?&nbsp; As soon as ever God had touched the jailor, he
cries out, &ldquo;Men and brethren, what must I do to be
saved?&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh! how many prayerless professors are there
in London that never pray?&nbsp; Coffee-houses will not let you
pray, trades will not let you pray, looking-glasses will not let
you pray; but if you were born of God, you would.</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, It is not only natural for a child to cry,
but it must crave the breast, it cannot live without the breast;
therefore Peter makes it the true trial of a new-born babe; the
new-born babe desires the sincere milk of the Word, that he may
grow thereby.&nbsp; If you be born of God, make it manifest by
desiring the breast of God.&nbsp; Do you long for the milk of
promises?&nbsp; A man lives one way when he is in the world,
another way when he is brought unto Jesus Christ; Isa. lxvi.,
&ldquo;They shall suck, and be satisfied.&rdquo;&nbsp; If you be
born again, there is no satisfaction till you get the milk of
God&rsquo;s word into your souls; Isa. lxvi. 11, &ldquo;To suck,
and be satisfied with the breasts of consolation.&rdquo;&nbsp; O
what is a promise to a carnal man; a whorehouse, it may be, is
more sweet to him; but if you be born again, you cannot live
without the milk of God&rsquo;s word.&nbsp; What is a
woman&rsquo;s breast to a horse?&nbsp; But what is it to a
child?&nbsp; There is its comfort night and day, there is its
succour night and day.&nbsp; O how loath is he it should be taken
from him.&nbsp; Minding heavenly things, says a carnal man, is
but vanity; but to a child of God, there is his comfort.</p>
<p><i>Thirdly</i>, A child that is newly born, if it have not
other comforts to keep it warm than it had in its mother&rsquo;s
womb, it dies.&nbsp; It must have something got for its succour;
so Christ had swaddling clothes prepared for him; so those that
are born again, they must have some promise of Christ to keep
them alive.&nbsp; Those that are in a carnal state, they warm
themselves with other things; but those that are born again, they
cannot live without some promise of Christ to keep them alive, as
he did to the poor infant in Ezekiel xvii., &ldquo;I covered thee
with embroidered gold.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when women are with
child, what fine things will they prepare for their child!&nbsp;
O but what fine things has Christ prepared to wrap all in that
are born again!&nbsp; O what wrappings of gold has Christ
prepared for all that are born again!&nbsp; Women will dress
their children, that every one may see them how fine they are; so
he in Ezekiel xvi. 11&mdash;&ldquo;I decked thee also with
ornaments, and I also put bracelets upon thine hands, and a chain
on thy neck.&nbsp; And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and
ear-rings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thine
head;&rdquo; and, says he in the 13th verse, &ldquo;thou didst
prosper to a kingdom.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is to set out nothing in
the world but the righteousness of Christ, and the graces of the
Spirit, without which a new-born babe cannot live, unless he have
the golden righteousness of Christ.</p>
<p><i>Fourthly</i>, A child when it is in its mother&rsquo;s lap,
the mother takes great delight to have that which will he for its
comfort; so it is with God&rsquo;s children, they shall he kept
on his knee; Isaiah lxvi. 11, &ldquo;They shall stick and be
satisfied with the breasts of her consolation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ver.
13, &ldquo;As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is a similitude in these things that
nobody knows of but those that are born again.</p>
<p><i>Fifthly</i>, There is usually some similitude betwixt the
father and the child; it may be the child looks like its father;
so those that are born again, they have a new similitude, they
have the image of Jesus Christ (Gal. iv.), every one that is born
of God has something of the features of heaven upon him.&nbsp;
Men love those children that are likest them most usually; so
does God his children; therefore they are called the children of
God.&nbsp; But others do not look like him, therefore they are
called Sodomites.&nbsp; Christ describes children of the devil by
their features; the children of the devil, his works they will
do; all works of unrighteousness, they are the devil&rsquo;s
works.&nbsp; If you are earthly, you have borne the image of the
earthly; if heavenly, you have borne the image of the
heavenly.</p>
<p><i>Sixthly</i>, When a man has a child, he trains him up to
his own liking, he learns the custom of his father&rsquo;s house;
so are those that are born of God; they have learned the custom
of the true church of God, there they learn to cry, My Father and
my God; they are brought up in God&rsquo;s house, they learn the
method and form of God&rsquo;s house for regulating their lives
in this world.</p>
<p><i>Seventhly</i>, Children, it is natural for them to depend
upon their father for what they want.&nbsp; If they want a pair
of shoes, they go and tell him; if they want bread, they go and
tell him; so should the children of God do.&nbsp; Do you want
spiritual bread? go tell God of it.&nbsp; Do you want strength of
grace? ask it of God.&nbsp; Do you want strength against
Satan&rsquo;s temptations? go and tell God of it.&nbsp; When the
devil tempts you, run home and tell your heavenly Father; go pour
out your complaints to God.&nbsp; This is natural to children; if
any wrong them, they go and tell their father; so do those that
are born of God, when they meet with temptations, go and tell God
of them.</p>
<p>The first use is this, to make a strict inquiry whether you be
born of God or not.&nbsp; Examine by those things I laid down
before of a child of nature and a child of grace.&nbsp; Are you
brought out of the dark dungeon of this world into Christ? have
you learned to cry, My Father? Jer. iii. 16, &ldquo;And I said,
Thou shalt call me thy Father.&rdquo;&nbsp; All God&rsquo;s
children are criers.&nbsp; Can you be quiet without you have a
bellyful of the milk of God&rsquo;s word?&nbsp; Can you be
satisfied without you have peace with God?&nbsp; Pray you
consider it, and be serious with yourselves.&nbsp; If you have
not these marks, you will fall short of the kingdom of God, you
shall never have an interest there; there is no intruding.&nbsp;
They will say, &ldquo;Lord, Lord, open to us; and he will say, I
know you not.&rdquo;&nbsp; No child of God, no heavenly
inheritance.&nbsp; We sometimes give something to those that are
not our children, but not our lands.&nbsp; O do not flatter
yourselves with a portion among the sons, unless you live like
sons.&nbsp; When we see a king&rsquo;s son play with a beggar,
this is unbecoming; so if you be the king&rsquo;s children, live
like the king&rsquo;s children.&nbsp; If you be risen with
Christ, set your affections on things above, and not on things
below.&nbsp; When you come together, talk of what your Father
promised you; you should all love your Father&rsquo;s will, and
be content and pleased with the exercises you meet with in the
world.&nbsp; If you are the children of God, live together
lovingly.&nbsp; If the world quarrel with you, it is no matter;
but it is sad if you quarrel together.&nbsp; If this be amongst
you, it is a sign of ill-breeding, it is not according to rules
you have in the Word of God.&nbsp; Dost thou see a soul that has
the image of God in him?&nbsp; Love him, love him; say, This man
and I must go to heaven one day.&nbsp; Serve one another, do good
for one another; and if any wrong you, pray to God to right you,
and love the brotherhood.</p>
<p><i>Lastly</i>, If you be the children of God, learn that
lesson: &ldquo;Gird up the loins of your mind as obedient
children, not fashioning yourselves according to your former
conversation; but be ye holy in all manner of
conversation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Consider that the holy God is your
father, and let this oblige you to live like the children of God,
that you may look your Father in the face with comfort another
day.</p>

267</span>BUNYAN&rsquo;S DYING SAYINGS.</h2>
<h3>OF SIN.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Sin</span> is the great block and bar to
our happiness, the procurer of all miseries to man, both here and
hereafter; take away sin, and nothing can hurt us; for death
temporal, spiritual, and eternal, is the wages of it.</p>
<p>Sin, and man for sin, is the object of the wrath of God.&nbsp;
How dreadful therefore must his case be who continues in sin; for
who can bear and grapple with the wrath of God?</p>
<p>No sin against God can be little, because it is against the
great God of heaven and earth; but if the sinner can find out a
<i>little</i> God, it may be easy to find out little sins.</p>
<p>Sin turns all God&rsquo;s grace into wantonness: it is the
<i>dare</i> of his justice; the <i>rape</i> of his mercy; the
<i>jeer</i> of his patience; the <i>slight</i> of his power; and
the <i>contempt</i> of his love.</p>
<p>Take heed of giving thyself liberty of committing one sin, for
that will lead thee to another; till by an ill custom it become
natural.</p>
<p>To begin sin is to lay a foundation for a continuance; this
continuance is the mother of custom, and impudence at last the
issue.</p>
<p>The death of Christ giveth us the best discovery of ourselves;
in what condition we were, so that nothing could help us but
that; and the most clear discovery of the dreadful nature of our
sins.&nbsp; For if sin be such a dreadful thing as to wring the
heart of the Son of God, how shall a poor wretched sinner be able
to bear it?</p>
<h3>OF AFFLICTION.</h3>
<p>Nothing can render affliction so heavy as the load of sin;
would you therefore be fitted for afflictions, be sure to get the
burden of your <i>sins</i> laid aside, and then what afflictions
soever you meet with will be very easy to you.</p>
<p>If thou canst hear and bear the rod of affliction which God
shall lay upon thee, remember this lesson, thou art <i>beaten</i>
that thou mayst be better.</p>
<p>The Lord useth his <i>flail</i> of tribulation to separate the
chaff from the wheat.</p>
<p>The school of the cross is the school of light; it discovers
the world&rsquo;s vanity, baseness, and wickedness, and lets us
see more of God&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; Out of dark affliction comes
a spiritual light.</p>
<p>In times of affliction we commonly meet with the sweetest
experiences of the love of God.</p>
<p>Did we heartily renounce the pleasures of this world, we
should be very little troubled for our afflictions; that which
renders an afflicted state so insupportable to many, is because
they are too much addicted to the pleasures of this life; and so
cannot endure that which makes a separation between them.</p>
<h3>OF REPENTANCE AND COMING TO CHRIST.</h3>
<p>The end of affliction is the discovery of sin; and of
<i>that</i> to bring us to the Saviour; let us therefore, with
the prodigal, return unto him, and we shall find ease and
rest.</p>
<p>A returning penitent, though formerly bad as the worst of men,
may by grace become as good as the best.</p>
<p>To be truly sensible of sin, is to sorrow for
<i>displeasing</i> of God: to be afflicted, that he is displeased
<i>by us</i> more than that he is displeased <i>with</i> us.</p>
<p>Your intentions to repentance, and the neglect of that
soul-saving duty, will rise up in judgment against you.</p>
<p>Repentance carries with it a <i>divine rhetoric</i>, and
persuades Christ to forgive multitudes of sins committed against
him.</p>
<p>Say not to thyself, to-morrow I will repent; for it is thy
duty to do it daily.</p>
<p>The gospel of grace and salvation is above all doctrine the
most dangerous, if it be received in <i>word</i> only by
graceless men; if it be not attended with a sensible need of a
Saviour, and bring them to him; for such men only as have the
<i>notion</i> of it, are of all men most miserable; for by reason
of their knowing more than heathens, this shall only be their
final portion, that they shall have greater stripes.</p>
<h3>OF PRAYER.</h3>
<p>Before you enter into prayer, ask thy soul these questions,
1.&nbsp; To what <i>end</i>, O my soul! art thou retired into
this place?&nbsp; Art thou come to converse with the Lord in
prayer?&nbsp; Is he present, will he hear thee?&nbsp; Is he
merciful, will he help thee?&nbsp; Is thy business slight, is it
not concerning the welfare of thy soul?&nbsp; What words wilt
thou use to move him to compassion?</p>
<p>To make thy preparation complete, consider that thou art but
<i>dust</i> and <i>ashes</i>; and he the great God, Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, <i>that clothes himself with light as with a
garment</i>; that thou art a vile sinner, and he a holy God; that
thou art but a poor crawling worm, and he the omnipotent
Creator.</p>
<p>In all your prayers, forget not to thank the Lord for his
mercies.</p>
<p>When thou prayest, rather let thy heart be without
<i>words</i> than thy words without <i>heart</i>.</p>
<p>Prayer will make a man cease from sin, or sin will entice a
man to cease from prayer.</p>
<p>The spirit of prayer is more precious than thousands of gold
and silver.</p>
<p>Pray often, for prayer is a shield to the soul, a sacrifice to
God, and a scourge for Satan.</p>
<h3>OF THE LORD&rsquo;S-DAYS, SERMONS, AND WEEK-DAYS.</h3>
<p>Have a special care to sanctify the Lord&rsquo;s-day; for as
thou keepest it, so will it be with thee all the week long.</p>
<p>Make the Lord&rsquo;s-day the <i>market</i> for thy soul; let
the whole day be spent in prayer, repetitions, or meditations;
lay aside the affairs of the other parts of the week; let the
sermon thou hast heard be converted into <i>prayer</i>: shall God
allow thee six days, and wilt thou not afford him one?</p>
<p>In the church, be careful to serve God; for thou art in his
eyes, and not in man&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Thou mayst hear sermons often, and do well in practising what
thou hearest; but thou must not expect to be told in a pulpit all
that thou oughtest to do, but be studious in reading the
Scriptures, and other good books; what thou hearest may be
forgotten, but what thou readest may better be retained.</p>
<p>Forsake not the public worship of God, lest God forsake thee;
not only in public, but in private.</p>
<p>On the week-day, when thou risest in the morning, consider,
1.&nbsp; Thou must die; 2.&nbsp; Thou mayst die that minute;
3.&nbsp; What will become of thy soul.&nbsp; Pray often.&nbsp; At
night consider, 1.&nbsp; What sins thou hast committed; 2.&nbsp;
How often thou hast prayed; 3.&nbsp; What hath thy mind been bent
upon; 4.&nbsp; What hath been thy dealing; 5.&nbsp; What thy
conversation; 6.&nbsp; If thou callest to mind the errors of the
day, sleep not without a confession to God, and a hope of
pardon.&nbsp; Thus, every morning and evening make up thy account
with Almighty God, and thy reckoning will be the less at
last.</p>
<h3>OF THE LOVE OF THE WORLD.</h3>
<p>Nothing more hinders a soul from coming to Christ than a vain
love of the <i>world</i>; and till a soul is freed from it, it
can never have a true love for God.</p>
<p>What are the honours and riches of this world, when compared
to the glories of a crown of life?</p>
<p>Love not the world, for it is a moth in a Christian&rsquo;s
life.</p>
<p>To despise the world is the way to enjoy heaven; and blessed
are they who delight to converse with God by prayer.</p>
<p>What folly can be greater than to labour for the meat that
perisheth, and neglect the food of eternal life?</p>
<p>God or the world must be neglected at <i>parting</i> time, for
then is the time of trial.</p>
<p>To seek yourself in this life is to be lost; and to be humble
is to be exalted.</p>
<p>The epicure that delighteth in the dainties of this world,
little thinketh that those very creatures will one day witness
against him.</p>
<h3>ON SUFFERING.</h3>
<p>It is not every suffering that makes a man a martyr; but
suffering for the Word of God after a right manner; that is, not
only for <i>righteousness</i>, but for righteousness&rsquo; sake;
not only for <i>truth</i>, but out of love to truth; not only for
God&rsquo;s Word, but according to it: to wit, in that holy,
humble, meek manner, as the Word of God requireth.</p>
<p>It is a rare thing to suffer aright, and to have my spirit in
suffering bent against God&rsquo;s enemy, sin.&nbsp; Sin in
doctrine, sin in worship, sin in life, and sin in
conversation.</p>
<p>Neither the devil, nor men of the world, can kill thy
righteousness, or love to it, but by thy own hand; or separate
that and thee asunder, without thy own act.&nbsp; Nor will he
that doth indeed suffer for the sake of it, or out of love he
bears thereto, be tempted to <i>exchange</i> it for the good will
of the whole world.</p>
<p>I have often thought that the best of Christians are found in
the worst times: and I have thought again, that one reason why we
are not better is, because God purges us no more.&nbsp; Noah and
Lot, who so <i>holy</i> as they in the time of their afflictions!
and yet, who so <i>idle</i> as they in the time of their
prosperity?</p>
<h3>OF DEATH AND JUDGMENT.</h3>
<p>As the devil labours by all means to keep out other things
that are good, so to keep out of the heart as much as in him
lies, the thoughts of passing out of this life into another
world; for he knows if he can but keep them from the serious
thoughts of <i>death</i>, he shall the more easily keep them in
their sins.</p>
<p>Nothing will make us more earnest in working out the work of
our salvation than a frequent meditation of mortality; nothing
hath a greater influence for the taking off our hearts from
vanities, and for the begetting in us desires for holiness.</p>
<p>O! sinner, what a condition wilt thou fall into when thou
departest the world; if thou depart unconverted, thou hadst
better have been <i>smothered</i> the first hour thou wast born;
thou hadst better have been plucked one limb from the other; thou
hadst better have been made a dog, a toad, a serpent, than to die
unconverted; and this thou wilt find true if thou repent not.</p>
<p>A man would be counted a fool to slight a judge before whom he
is to have a trial of his whole estate.&nbsp; The trial we are to
have before God is of <i>otherwise</i> importance; it concerns
our eternal happiness or misery, and yet dare we affront him.</p>
<p>The only way for us to escape that terrible judgment is to be
often passing a sentence of condemnation upon ourselves here.</p>
<p>When the sound of the trumpet shall be heard, which shall
summon the dead to appear before the tribunal of God, the
righteous shall hasten out of their graves with joy to meet their
Redeemer in the clouds; others shall call to the mountains and
hills to fall upon them, to cover them from the sight of their
judge; let us, therefore, in time be <i>posing</i> ourselves
which of the <i>two</i> we shall be.</p>
<h3>OF THE JOYS OF HEAVEN.</h3>
<p>There is no good in this life but what is mingled with some
evil: honours perplex, riches disquiet, and pleasures ruin
health.&nbsp; But in heaven we shall find blessings in their
purity, without any ingredient to imbitter; with everything to
sweeten it.</p>
<p>O! who is able to conceive the inexpressible, inconceivable
joys that are there!&nbsp; None but they who have tasted of
them.&nbsp; Lord, help us to put such a value upon them here,
that in order to prepare ourselves for them, we may be willing to
forego the loss of all those deluding pleasures here.</p>
<p>How will the heavens echo for joy, when the bride, the
Lamb&rsquo;s wife, shall come to dwell with her husband for
ever!</p>
<p>Christ is the desire of nations, the joy of angels, the
delight of the Father; what solace then must the soul be filled
with, that hath the possession of him to all eternity!</p>
<p>O! what acclamations of joy will there be, when all the
children of God shall meet together, without fear of being
disturbed by the anti-Christian and Cainish brood.</p>
<p>Is there not a time coming when the godly may ask the wicked,
what profit they have in their pleasure? what comfort in their
greatness? and what fruit in all their labour?</p>
<p>If you would be better satisfied what the beatifical vision
means, my request is, that you would live <i>holily</i> and go
and see.</p>
<h3>OF THE TORMENTS OF HELL.</h3>
<p>Heaven and salvation is not surely <i>more</i> promised to the
godly, than hell and damnation is threatened to, and shall be
executed on, the wicked.</p>
<p>Oh! who knows the power of God&rsquo;s wrath?&nbsp; None but
damned ones.</p>
<p>Sinners&rsquo; company are the devil and his angels, tormented
in everlasting fire with a curse.</p>
<p>Hell would be a kind of paradise, if it were no worse than the
<i>worst</i> of this world.</p>
<p>As different as grief is from joy, as torment from rest, as
terror from peace; so different is the state of sinners from that
of <i>saints</i> in the world to come.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
